make sure you have version 3.22 or later.  Older versions of procmail contain
bugs that may cause mailbox corruption.

<P>
Supervisory access (root) is not required, but may help under some
circumstances.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
1.2 Initial Steps</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you're upgrading, don't forget to read the
<A HREF="ask_doc.html#sec:upgrade-instructions">Upgrade Instructions</A>.
The upgrade instructions must be followed carefully. A misconfigured system
will not only make you miss important emails but also send confirmations to
mailing lists and such. Those things will make you a very unpopular person
and that's generally a bad idea. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
1.3 Installation Instructions</A>
</H2>

<P>
ASK comes pre-packaged in three different formats: an RPM file for RedHat
users, a DEB file for Debian users and a compressed tar file that can be used
under any unix variant.  Usually, you should opt for the pre-packaged file
(RPM or DEB) if you have one of those systems and root access. If that's not
the case, follow the tarball installation instructions.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00034000000000000000">
1.4 RPM-based Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you have a RPM based system (RedHat, Conectiva, etc), just download the
respective RPM file, login as root and type:

<P>
<PRE>
rpm -ivh ask-X.XX-X.noarch.rpm
</PRE>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00035000000000000000">
1.5 DEB-based Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
If your system uses the Debian packaging format, just download the respective 
DEB file, login as root and type:

<P>
<PRE>
dpkg -i ask_X.XX-X_all.deb
</PRE>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00036000000000000000">
1.6 Tarball Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
Use this method if you're just a regular user trying to use ASK or if you
don't want to use the pre-packaged files. In this case, all you have to do is
unpack ASK somewhere, like this:

<P>
<PRE>
tar zxvf ask-X.XX.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>
This command creates a directory named ``ask-x.xx'', where ``x.xx'' is
the current ASK version.

<P>
This method is the only alternative for those without root access.  In this
case, just unpack the tarball under your home directory.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00037000000000000000">
1.7 Common Installation Procedures</A>
</H2>

<P>
The rest of the installation is the same regardless of the method chosen.

<P>
First, run <TT>asksetup.py</TT> to create the <TT>.ask</TT> directory
under your home directory and install a basic configuration file named
<TT>$HOME/.askrc</TT>. This step is required for every user that uses ASK
(even if you installed using the RPM or DEB installation options).

<P>
Next, edit the <TT>$HOME/.askrc</TT> file and change the variables
accordingly. There are some important points to note:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <TT>rc_askdir</TT> parameter points to the directory where ASK's data
  files and lists are kept. You may think of it as the program's ``work
  directory''. The default is <TT>$HOME/.ask</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change the <TT>rc_mymails</TT> parameter to contain your email
  addresses. Add all email addresses where you receive email, separated
  by commas.

<P>
Example:

<P>
<PRE>
rc_mymails = mymail@domain.com, myothermail@otherdomain.com
</PRE>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change <TT>rc_mymailbox</TT> to point to your mailbox. Most installations 
  set the default mailbox to a file named with your username under 
  ``/var/mail'' or ``/var/spool/mail''.

<P>
If you use a mail-directory instead of a mailbox (Qmail), just append a ``/'' (slash) to
  the mailbox name. A very common approach under Qmail for example, is to use a Maildir 
  called ``Maildir'' under the user's home directory. In this case, the <TT>rc_mymailbox</TT>
  parameter should be set to something like:

<P>
<PRE>
rc_mymailbox = /home/yourloginname/Mailbox/
</PRE>
<P>
The slash at the end tells ASK to use this directory as a Maildir-style mailbox.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change <TT>rc_md5_key</TT> to any string. This key is used to generate
  a unique MD5 signature. This string doesn't appear anywhere and should be
  unique. Make sure you change it! This parameter does not need to be changed
  after the initial installation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Your <TT>rc_mailkey</TT> can be any string, but it must appear on all
  emails you send. A good idea is to pick an unusual word or combination
  of characters from your signature. Make sure every email message you send
  contains this string. Try to pick something without spaces as some
  mailers tend to break phrases in mysterious ways and that could cause your
  mailkey not to be recognized. Do not use your name as the mailkey! This
  would case a lot of spam to be delivered as some spammers know not only
  your address but also your name.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The default for the remaining options should be appropriate for most users.

<P>
Make sure that your signature contains your mailkey. Send yourself an email
and double check it.

<P>

2 Configuration</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
2.1 Configuring Your Lists</A>
</H2>

<P>
ASK uses three lists, stored as text files, under the directory specified
by the <TT>rc_askdir</TT> parameter. These text files are named
``whitelist.txt'', ``ignorelist.txt'' and ``blacklist.txt'' for the white,
ignore and black lists respectively. The lists contain a set of rules
that determine the fate of a message that reaches the system. A match in
the whitelist will cause immediate delivery of the message. A match in
the ignorelist will cause the message to be discarded and a match in the
blacklist will not only discard the message but also send a ``nastygram''
back to the sender.

<P>
There are no default list files in the installation package. If ASK cannot
find a list file, it assumes ``empty'' as the default. This means that
confirmation messages will be sent to everybody.

<P>
ASK uses regular expressions to match incoming emails to the lists. It's
important to get acquainted with some basic regular expression concepts. We
present below a sample whitelist with some common cases:

<P>
<PRE>
from friend@bla\.org
crazy-people@yahoogroups\.com
from resume
to @lists\.sourceforge.net
from \.gov$
from ^info@
subject job offer
header ^X-Spam-Status: no
</PRE>
<P>
We now discuss each rule in more detail:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><code>from friend@bla\.org</code>: Immediately accept any emails coming
    from ``friend@bla.org''.  Note that dots are ``escaped'' with a
    backslash. This indicates that we want to match a real dot. Without the
    backslash, a dot means ``any character''.

<P>
Observe that without extra treatment, this rule would also match
    ``friend@bla.org.br'', but ASK knows that this is an email address
    and internally adjusts the regular expression to match only
    ``friend@bla.org''.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>crazy-people@yahoogroups\.com</code>: This entry does
    not contain the ``from'' qualifier, so ASK adds it internally. Entries
    like ``from x@y and ``x@y'' are completely equivalent, but you should
    always use the ``from'' qualifier as it makes the lists more readable.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>from resume</code>: This entry matches the word ``resume'' anywhere in
    the sender's email address. Addresses like ``resume@domain.com'',
    ``test@resume.com'', ``whatever@yourresume.com'' will be gladly accepted. Use
    with care.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>to @lists\.sourceforge\.net</code>: Emails going to
    any address at ``lists.sourceforge.net'' are accepted immediately. This
    is a good way to handle mailing-lists that put the mailing list address
    in the ``To:'' field.

<P>
Email addresses are composed of two parts: The ``username'' part to the 
	left of the ``@'' sign and the ``domain'' part to the right of the ``@'' 
	sign. In this case, no username part exists, causing ASK to employ a 
	substring match. Fully formed emails cause ASK to match an email address
	exactly.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>from \.gov$</code>: Matches anything coming from a ``.gov''
    domain. The dollar sign at the end of the rule means ``Match the
    end of the line here''. Without it, this regular expression would
    match any addresses with ``.gov'', like ``whatever@bla.gov.mx'' and
    ``jose.gove@test.com''.

<P>
Observe that when a full email is used in the regexp, ASK internally
    appends the ``$'' sign to it. That's why ``from test@domain.com'' is
    equivalent to ``from ^test@domain.com$''.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>from ^info@</code>: The caret sign (^) matches the beginning of the
    line. This regular expressions matches any email addresses beginning with
    ``info@'', like ``info@domain.com''.  It will not match ``info'' in any other
    part of the email address, like ``mailinfo@domain.com''.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>subject job offer</code>: it's also possible to match the message
    subject.  This rule will match the words ``job offer'' anywhere in the
    subject. Use with care.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>header ^X-Spam-Status: no</code>: this rule will match a header called
    ``X-Spam-Status'' with ``no'' anywhere in its contents. This allows ASK to
    be cascaded with other anti-spam solutions like
	<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</A>.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
ASK never sends confirmations to mailing-lists. If ASK detects a message from
a mailing-list it queues the message with the status of ``Bulk'', unless a
match happens in the whitelist.  ASK uses some heuristics to determine wether
a message is coming from a mailing-list or not.

<P>
If you are subscribed to a mailing-list make sure you have the list address
in your whitelist. Add a ``from mailing-list-address'' if your mailing list
sends out emails with the mailing-address in the ``From:'' (or ``Reply-To:'')
field. Add ``to mailing-list-address'' if your mailing-list sends out emails
with the original sender name in the ``From:'' field and the email list address
in the ``To:'' field.

<P>
Do not publish your whitelist or someone may use one of its addresses to
deliver spam to your mailbox.

<P>
The other lists follow the same rules. See below for a blacklist example:

<P>
<PRE>
from boss@boringcompany\.com
from @spam
from exwife@bloodsuckinglawyers.com
</PRE>
<P>
These people will not only be ignored but will also receive a nastygram
back. Be careful about who you put here! You don't want to send unnecessary
nastygrams. In most cases, you should add people you don't want to receive
emails to <TT>ignorelist.txt</TT>. In that case, the email will be silently
ignored.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
2.2 Generating the Initial Whitelist</A>
</H2>

<P>
ASK comes with a program called <TT>asksenders.py</TT> that can be used to
create an initial whitelist.

<P>
<TT>asksenders.py</TT> reads an mbox formatted mailbox on the standard input
and outputs the rules to whitelist all email addresses found on the mailbox.
The list can be saved as the whitelist, immediately granting access to past
correspondents.

<P>
For more information, type <code>asksenders.py --help</code> at the command prompt.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
2.3 Final Configuration Steps</A>
</H2>

<P>
The final configuration step is to configure your Mail Transfer Agent to pipe
every incoming mail into ASK for processing.  This procedure varies according
to your MTA and other factors. The following sections contain installation
details for popular MTAs and mail filters.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00043100000000000000">
2.3.1 Sendmail, Exim and Postfix Users</A>
</H3>

<P>
Create a file named <TT>$HOME/.forward</TT> with the following line:

<P>
<PRE>
"|/path/ask.py --loglevel=5 --logfile=/your_home/ask.log --home=/your_home"
</PRE>
<P>
Make sure you substitute ``path'' for the correct location where the 
<TT>ask.py</TT> executable is installed, and make sure that you copy
the quotes (") to your file - they are part of it.

<P>
Now, change the file permissions with:

<P>
<PRE>
chmod 600 $HOME/.forward
</PRE>
<P>
This configuration causes ASK to monitor your emails and generate log
messages to a file named ``ask.log'' under your home directory.

<P>
Send yourself some emails (make sure your email signature contains your
mailkey).  ASK some friends not yet in your whitelist to send you some emails
and see if they receive the confirmation message. Ask them to reply to the
confirmation message and watch in awe as their email addresses magically
appear in your whitelist!

<P>
Monitor your log files for a while, to make sure no confirmation messages are
being sent to mailing lists or other places where they shouldn't. When you
are satisfied with ASK's operation, reduce the logging level to 1 to save
disk space.

<P>
If you are using Sendmail and the message ``xxx not available for sendmail
programs'' appears in your logs, you need to create a symlink from
<TT>smrsh</TT>'s (Sendmail's restricted shell utility) directory for
restricted programs to the actual <TT>ask.py</TT> executable. Under RedHat
Linux, this directory is normally <TT>/etc/smrsh</TT> but it changes from
Unix to Unix. For more details on this issue (and exact instructions on how
to create the symlink), please visit The Sendmail FAQ, Section 3.34 at
<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section3.html#3.34">http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section3.html#3.34</A>.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00043200000000000000">
2.3.2 Alternative Exim Installation</A>
</H3>

<P>
Joe Vaughan was kind enough to supply an alternative way of installing ASK
with Exim. This method requires some modifications to be performed on Exim's
configuration file (<TT>/etc/exim.conf</TT>), so root access (and some
familiarity with Exim 3) are required.

<P>
You don't need to use this method to make ASK work with Exim. You can use the
<TT>.forward</TT> mechanism as described in previous sections.

<P>
First, edit your <TT>/etc/exim.conf</TT> file and locate the ``Transports''
section. Add the following lines:

<P>
<PRE>
ask_pipe:
  driver = pipe
  command="/usr/bin/ask.py --loglevel=10 --logfile=/home/$local_part/ask.log"
  return_path_add
  delivery_date_add
  envelope_to_add
  check_string = "From "
  escape_string = "&gt;From "
  user = $local_part
  group = mail
</PRE>
<P>
Install ASK from the RPM or DEB packages if use this configuration. This will
guarantee that the <TT>ask.py</TT> script is installed under <TT>/usr/bin</TT>.

<P>
The next step is to locate locate the ``Directors'' section. Add a new
director with the lines:

<P>
<PRE>
ask:
  driver = localuser
  transport = ask_pipe
  require_files = ${local_part}:+${home}:+${home}/.askrc:+/usr/bin/ask.py
  no_verify
</PRE>
<P>
Change the directories to suit your needs

<P>
The new director is called ``ask''. Order matters. You can put it before or
after your ``procmail'' director, depending which one you want executed first.
Don't forget to restart exim after you finish the changes.

<P>
This will provide ASK to all users on the system. Note that individual users
must still run <TT>asksetup.py</TT> to create the <TT>.askrc</TT> directory,
copy the template <TT>.askrc</TT> file, etc.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00043300000000000000">
2.3.3 Qmail Users</A>
</H3>

<P>
If you're using Qmail, edit the <TT>.qmail</TT> file under your home directory
and add the following line:

<P>
<PRE>
| preline /path_to_ask/ask.py --loglevel=5 --logfile=/your_home/ask.log
</PRE>
<P>
Make sure this file is not readable by anyone else. At the command prompt, type:

<P>
<PRE>
chmod 600 $HOME/.qmail
</PRE>
<P>
Monitor the log file and change the logging level to 1 when you're satisfied 
with ASK's operation.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00043400000000000000">
2.3.4 Procmail Users</A>
</H3>

<P>
ASK supports procmail directly through the ``-procmail'' switch. In this
mode, ASK works as a mail filter and returns an error code telling procmail
whether a message should be delivered or not. If a message needs to be
de-queued, stdin is substituted and the appropriate code is returned to
procmail.

<P>
To use ASK in this fashion, your first procmail rules should be:

<P>
<PRE>
--- cut here ---
:0 fW
|/path_to_ask/ask.py --procmail --loglevel=5 --logfile=/your_home/ask.log

:0 e
/dev/null
--- cut here ---
</PRE>
<P>
Pay special attention to the blank line between the rules. They are
important. Any rules coming after this block will receive email ``sanitized''
by ASK.

<P>
The second rule above instructs procmail to deliver the message to
<TT>/dev/null</TT> if ASK returns a fail code. If you're truly paranoid, you
can save those messages to a file instead for later inspection. Keep in mind
however, that doing so will not alter the fact that ``they'' are after you. It 
will not stop the voices from talking to you either.

<P>
As usual, set the logging level to one when you're satisfied with ASK's
operation.  This will help conserve disk space.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
3 Remote Commands</A>
</H1>

<P>
ASK checks the ``Subject'' line of incoming mails, looking for special
strings called ``Remote Commands''. By sending emails to your own account
using these strings, it is possible to manage the queue, edit the lists and
others.

<P>
ASK understand two flavors of remote commands: HTML mode and Text Mode. You
can select the desired mode by locating editing your <TT>.askrc</TT> file
and changing the <TT>rc_remote_cmd_htmlmail</TT> parameter to ``on'' or
``off''. HTML mode requires an HTML capable mail reader. Text Mode can be
used with any mail reader.

<P>
To find out about the available remote commands, send yourself a message with
``ASK HELP'' in the subject. ASK will reply with the list of commands.

3.1 Queue Management</A>
</H2>

<P>
When ASK sends a confirmation message, it stores the original message under
the <TT>$HOME/.ask/queue</TT> directory. The original message remains
``queued'' until the sender replies to the confirmation. As most spammers
send their emails using forged return addresses, it is impossible for them
to reply to the confirmation, causing the original message to remain queued
forever.

<P>
It is recommended to check the contents of the queue periodically, removing
old messages and delivering any messages of interest. You can remotely
control the contents of your queue by sending yourself an email with the
string ``ASK PROCESS QUEUE'' in the subject line. ASK will reply with all the
queued files. You will be able to delete messages, add the message sender
to one of your lists, dequeue messages, etc. Note that if you're using HTML
mode, you will be able to click on certain links inside the email to process
the messages. Text mode users need to edit the message and send it back to
ASK for processing (A ''Reply'' usually works well).

3.2 List Management</A>
</H2>

<P>
It is also possible to edit the lists (whitelist, ignorelist and
blacklist) via email.  To that purpose, just send yourself a message with
``ASK&nbsp;EDIT&nbsp;<I>list</I>'', where list is one of ``WHITELIST'', ``IGNORELIST'',
or ``BLACKLIST.'' ASK will send you back an email with the contents of your
list and further instructions.
